#where are you getting Dynamic tool from only saw this in some js langchain doc? I think this should be just from langchain,gets import Tool also you need to define the tool format its kind of a complicated json. Also what is the tool here you need to write python code to load the json into a function and run otherwise the tool doesn't do anything
