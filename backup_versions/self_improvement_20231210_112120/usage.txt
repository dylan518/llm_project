**Usage Instructions:**
To add python functions to the codefile generate Python functions in this format:

```python
def example_function():
    print('This is a simple example function that prints out a message.')
```
ensure def is directly after python and that ```python and ``` are on their own lines. there should be nothing before or after the function. All imports will automatically be handled don't add imports.
Existing functions will be replaced, and new ones added. This is the code of the target file.
