Task: Palindrome Checker

Your task is to develop a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Specifications:

Palindrome Checker:
Write a function named is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool that takes in a string s and returns True if it's a palindrome and False otherwise.
Constraints:
The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when determining if a string is a palindrome.
The function should be efficient and handle strings of varying lengths.
